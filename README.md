# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-Bike-Share-Aanlysis
For my capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Course, I have decided to take on the Cyclistic case study. I will be taking on the role of a data analyst for Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. I have followed the six steps in the process detailed in the course, which are Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.  I completed the project using R programming.
